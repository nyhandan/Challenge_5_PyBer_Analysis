# Challenge 5: PyBer Analysis
Attempt #1 by Dan Nyhan

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to efficiently present how [PyBer's rideshare data]() differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. We used our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Deliverable 1 is a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type and Deliverable 2 is a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Ride-share Summary Dataframe
![Deliverable 1](https://github.com/nyhandan/Challenge_5_PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge_5_PyBer/Deliverable_1.png)
From this dataframe summary, we can some big differences in descriptive statistics. The average fare per ride in an urban cities is about 10 dollars higher than in the rural cities! The average fare per driver in the urban city is also significantly higher than in the rural setting, $55 vs. ~$17, respectively. The suburban fares tend to fall right in the middle for each statistic. The sample size ranking of city, in descending order, is Urban, Suburban, then Rural. 


### Deliverable 2: Multiple-line Chart of Total Fares for each City Type

From this chart, the fare price for each city type is displayed. The fare price velocity is generally the same for each city type, but the maginitude of change is quite different. The urban and subruban prices trends tend to flucatuate more aggressively, whereas the rural price trends are more stable. 


## Summary
A savvy decision the CEO should do is expand the consumer base in the urban cities. There are lots of drivers in the city, but their wage margins are lower because there is excess supply of drivers. The fare price could be lowered but the total earnings could increase if there is more demand for drivers. Another move the CEO should make is to figure out ways to recruit more drivers in rural areas. The fare per driver is so high in rural areas, probably because there are only 78 rural drivers sampled (there are 2405 urban drivers). More business will come PyBer's way with cheaper prices for consumers anyways. A third thing the CEO could do is focus on expanding suburban revenues, most likely by increasing the amount of drivers and consumers, so taking the potential strategies of both other city types.
