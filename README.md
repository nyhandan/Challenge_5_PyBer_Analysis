# Challenge 5: PyBer Analysis
Attempt #1 by Dan Nyhan

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to efficiently present how [this data](https://github.com/nyhandan/Challenge_5_PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Challenge_5_PyBer/Resources) differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. We used our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Deliverable 1 is a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type and Deliverable 2 is a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Ride-share Summary Dataframe
![Deliverable 1]()



### Deliverable 2: Multiple-line Chart of Total Fares for each City Type
